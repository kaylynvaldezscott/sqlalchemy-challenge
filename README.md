Purpose of assignment is to provide climate analysis on the area of Honolulu, Hawaii. Using Python and SQL Alchemy, I am able to answer and provide answers on:
- Find the most recent date in the dataset.
- Using that date, get the previous 12 months of precipitation data by querying the previous 12 months of data.
- Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame. Explicitly set the column names.
- Sort the DataFrame values by "date".
- Plot the results by using the DataFrame plot method

As well as providing a station analysis to answer:
- Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset.
- Design a query to find the most-active stations (that is, the stations that have the most rows).
- List the stations and observation counts in descending order.
- Filter by the station that has the greatest number of observations.
- Query the previous 12 months of TOBS data for that station.
- Plot the results as a histogram with bins=12

Using this information, I then use Flask API's to show my climate analysis online using different routes as options to explore. See file labeled 'app_Kaylyn_Challenge.py'.
